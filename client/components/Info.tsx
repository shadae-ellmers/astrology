      <h2>Here is what all this astrology mumbo-jumbo means.</h2>
      <p>
        A natal chart is a map of the sky from when and where you were born that
        shows which constellation (sign) a planet was in front of when you were
        born. This is the first known celestial coordinate system. It&apos;s
        been a way of telling time for four thousand years. In astrology, a
        natal chart indicates your character traits, behavioral tendencies,
        hidden desires, and the directions your life might take. It shows the
        location of each planet, along with the sign and house it appeared in at
        that moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though your chart can provide significant information, they only provide
        an insight into a person, and not the end-all-be-all. These are planet
        placements at birth and so, is a starting point. External influences and
        environmental factors also steer a person&apos;s life.
      </p>
      <h3>What do the planets represent?</h3>
      <p>Each planet represents a different kind of energy.</p>
      <h3>What are houses and what do they represent?</h3>
      <p>
        Houses are based on the Earth&apos;s 24-hour rotation around its own
        axis. The sky is divided into 12 sections, and each section is a house,
        which represents an area of your life. These positions are fixed in the
        sky and what changes are the constellations (signs) and planets that
        move across the sky.
      </p>
      <h3>How does this all mesh together?</h3>
      <p>
        It can be helpful to think of the relationship between houses, planets,
        and signs as questions of “where,” “what,” and “how,” respectively. The
        houses represent specific areas in which situations might arise. The
        planets represent the kinds of energy that you could bring to those
        situations. The signs, finally, represent how that energy is expressed.
      </p>
      <h2>What&apos;s the deal with the big three?</h2>
      <p>
        A person&apos;s big three refers to their sun, moon, and rising
        placements in their natal chart. These are general indicators for a
        person&apos;s personality, without the complication of the entire chart.
      </p>
      <h3>Sun Sign</h3>
      <p>
        The Sun sign corresponds to the zodiac sign the Sun appeared to be in
        front of when you are born. Because the Earth completes one revolution
        around the Sun each year, the Sun moves through all the zodiac signs in
        the same order every year. The Sun sign represents energy relating to
        ego, identity, and role in life.
      </p>
      <h3>Moon Sign</h3>
      <p>
        The Moon sign corresponds to the zodiac sign the Moon appeared to be in
        front of when you are born. The Moon sign represents energy relating to
        emotions, moods, and feelings.
      </p>
      <h3>Rising Sign</h3>
      <p>
        The Rising sign (also known as Ascendent) is the zodiac sign that was on
        the eastern horizon when and where you were born. This sign changes
        every 2 hours, going through all the zodiac signs in the 24 hour day.
        Some astrologers think of the rising sign as how you present yourself in
        the world. Others think of it as your lens on the world.
